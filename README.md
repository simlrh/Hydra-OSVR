# Hydra-OSVR

Hydra emulation for OSVR. Use these libraries in place of the official sixense libraries to pull controller data from OSVR.

On Windows you will also need to copy osvrClientKit.dll, osvrClient.dll, osvrUtil.dll and osvrCommon.dll from your OSVR installation into the same directory.

If you're using SteamVR and get errors, the OSVR libraries probably don't match those used by SteamVR-OSVR. Copy the libraries from the SteamVR-OSVR driver directory instead.
